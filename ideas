Tasks:
1. Shoot down a nonmoving target
1b. shoot down a moving target
1c. (opt) Shoot down an unpredictably moving target.
2. Move and stop within radius.
2b. Move to and shoot down target.

3b. Get around objects.
3c. Navigate trough maze.
4. Avoid shots.


Shoot down a still target.
Shoot down a moving target.
Move to within radius.
Avoid crash.
Dodge shots.

Now combine the different bots to one bot with all the same functionalities.

Introductory tasks
Write a separate AI for each task.

1. Shoot down stationary target
Map: empty.xp
AI: Continually changing spawnpoint, stationary

2. Shoot down a moving target.
http://playtechs.blogspot.se/2007/04/aiming-at-moving-target.html
Map: Empty, edgewrap
AI: Picking random direction and flying at semi-ranom constant speed, changing direction when dying

3. Fly to enemy
Map: Empty, edgdwrap, low friction, allowPlayercrashes: no
AI: Same as 1.

4. Avoid crashing
Map: Simple.xp? Walls, low friction

5. Dodge incoming shots.
Map: Empty, edgewrap, low friction.

Combine all these into one big AI preserving all functionality.

After that add further functionality
