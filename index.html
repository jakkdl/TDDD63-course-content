<h1>TDDD63: XPilot-AI project</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Computer games have given rise to a huge industry in the latest
  decade or two.  As you are certainly aware of, these games are
  generally interactive: You &ndash; the player &ndash; must
  personally control what happens for a long period of time.  In a
  racing game you must control a car, choosing the right gear and
  steering in the right direction.  In Tetris you must move and rotate
  colored blocks, and so on.  This obviously takes a lot of time.
  Wouldn't it be nice if you had someone else who could play the
  games <em>for</em> you, relieving you of this great burden and
  allowing you to spend more time developing software instead?
</p>

<p>
  Well, maybe not.  But it can still be a lot of fun to take a
  completely different approach to gaming: Trying to write
  a <em>bot</em>, a software robot, that plays the game for you.  This
  idea is not new and has in fact led to the concept of
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game">programming
  games</a>, where you can measure your programming skills against
  those of your opponents or simply against the game itself.
</p>

<p>
  Programming games have history of over 50 years, going back at least
  to the year 1961
  when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_%28programming_game%29">Darwin</a>
  was invented.  In this programming game, players were executed on
  an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7090">IBM 7090</a>, a
  multi-million-dollar 0.46 MHz 36-bit mainframe (not 32!) with 144 kB
  of memory that was one of the first generations of computers running
  on transistors rather than vacuum tubes.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately for you we do not have such a system available, so you
  will instead be using Python on the IDA Sun machines.  You will also
  use a different game as the basis for your bots.  There is a classic
  game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPilot">XPilot</a>
  where the players control a spaceship flying around and trying to
  shoot the enemy. XPilot-AI is an existing project that adds the
  possibility to write Python programs that control the spaceships
  using artificial intelligence (AI). The goal of your TDDD63 project,
  then, will be to write programs that
  implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent">intelligent
  agents</a> (bots)
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system">teams
  of intelligent agents</a> that control the spaceships.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="http://xpilot-ai.org/">official XPilot-AI</a> is maintained at
  Connecticut College, but
  over the course of the summer John Litborn, a student at LiU, have
  forked the code and improved on it. The code is open source and
  anybody can read the code and report bugs, request features and
  submit patches. Interested students can contact him at johli603@student.liu.se 
  or through your assistant.

others the hybrid deliberate/reactive paradigm are needed.  </p>

<h2>Installation and Running Programs</h2>

<h3>On Student Sun Systems</h3>

<p>The programs needed are already installed on the Sun system for
students. The path to the binaries and libraries is:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">   /home/TDDD63/projects/xpilot-ai/</pre>

<p>You have to make sure that the binaries and libraries are found. To
do that on the Sun system do the following:</p><p>
</p><pre class="sh_sh">   module add /home/TDDD63/modulefiles/xpilot-ai
</pre>

<p>Or to permanently add it to an init file (you just have to do this
  once and then the module will be added automatically every time you
  log in):</p><p>
</p><pre class="sh_sh">   module initadd /home/TDDD63/modulefiles/xpilot-ai
</pre>

<h3>On Linux or Mac</h3>

<p>
  If you want to run this on your own Linux computer, download and install
  the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hatten/xpilot-ai-fork/raw/master/xpilot-ai-fork-linux.sh">installation script</a>.
  The script might not work completely out of the box and you might need some
  previous knowledge of the command-line to get it working.
  </p>

<p>On your platform you have to make sure that libraries and other
files are found. Here is an example of how to do that in the .bashrc
file when XPilot-AI is installed in /home/tompe/pkg/xpilot-ai:</p>

<pre class="sh_sh">   #
   # Place the following three lines at the end of the .bashrc file
   #
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tompe/pkg/xpilot-ai/python:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   export PYTHONPATH=/home/tompe/pkg/xpilot-ai/python:$PYTHONPATH
   export PATH=/home/tompe/pkg/xpilot-ai:$PATH
</pre>

<h3>Running Remotely</h3>

<p>It is possible to run these programs on a Sun server and still view
  their graphical user interface on your own computer, at home or at
  the university.  To do this, you need
  an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window
  System</a> server (the standard Unix/Linux window system) on your
  own computer, where the GUI will be displayed.  This is most likely
  already installed if you are using a Linux machine.  If you are
  using Windows, you can install and
  use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xming">Xming</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If you do have an X Window System Server on your machine, you can
  then log in to the <code>remote-und</code> server at IDA using SSH.  If
  you are using Linux, you do the following:</p>

<pre class="sh_sh">ssh -X LiuId123@remote-und.ida.liu.se
</pre>

<p>This gives you a command prompt on <code>remote-und</code>, where
  any graphical program started on that machine will be displayed on
  your own computer.  If you are using Windows, you will have to find
  a suitable SSH client, for
  example <a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> (a PuTTY version
  can optionally be installed during the Xming install process) and
  configure it for X forwarding.</p>

<h3>Virtual Ubuntu Machine</h3>

<p><!--TODO: Check that it works on newer ubuntu versions-->
  XPilot-AI currently does not work natively on Windows.  If you still
  want to run the project locally on a Windows machine, one possible
  solution is to install Ubuntu 12.04 in a virtual machine. One way to
  do that is to
  install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>, create
  an Ubuntu 12.04 virtual machine, and then go through the Linux
  installation instructions above.
</p>


<h2>Different Python versions</h2>
<!--TODO: Update-->
<p>Here is a list giving the default python3 version on different systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sun System: Python 3.2.2</li>
<li>Ubuntu 12.04: Python 3.2.3</li>
<li>Debian Stable: Python 3.1.3</li>
<li>Mac Mountain Lion 10.8: Seems not to be installed. If installing it yourself: Python 3.3.0</li>
<li>Windows: No Python installed as default. If installing it yourself: Python 3.3.0</li>
</ul>
<!--TODO: Update-->
<p>The assistant uses Debian Stable and will use this to test against
when getting email questions, so the best thing is <b>not to use Python
    language constructs that only exist in 3.2 or higher!</b></p>


<h2>Playing a Game</h2>

<p>It is recommended that you play some games of XPilot to become more
familiar with it and explore its functionality.</p>

<h3>Starting a Server</h3>

<p>
  The first step to take when you want to play a game of XPilot is to
  start a game server.  It is important to know that if you want to
  start more than one XPilot server on the same computer you have to
  use different ports for the different servers.  This may not be the
  case if you are working on your own computer, but several SunRay
  clients in the Sun PULs can connect to the same Sun server and
  therefore there could be <b>conflicts with other groups</b>, even
  those working in another PUL.  Because of that the XPilot server
  should start on a unique port for different project groups if you
  are not running on a private computer. The default port is
  15345. Each group has a number n and should use port 15345+n to
  avoid connecting to each other's servers. For example, group 5 uses
  the port 15350.
</p>

<p>Start the server with the default map (assuming group 1):</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">    xpilots -noQuit +reportToMetaServer -port 15346
</pre>

<a name="reportToMetaServer"></a>
<a name="reportMeta"></a>
<p>The flag <code>+reportToMetaServer</code> means that your locally
  started server will NOT report to the central meta server that keeps
  track of all currently running XPilot servers across the Internet.
  This is to avoid having other players around the world joining your
  game. You can also use +reportMeta, which is a shorter alias.
</p>

<p>The flag <code>-noQuit</code> will make the server stay alive after
  every player quit. This is often convenient but you can remove the 
  option if that is undesired.
</p>

<p>By default you can only connect 2 clients from the same IP number to a server.
To change that use the flag <code>-maxClientsPerIP</code>. For example:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">    xpilots -noQuit +reportToMetaServer -port 15346 -maxClientsPerIP 10
</pre>



<h3>Starting a Client</h3>

<p>Start a client:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">    xpilot -join -port 15346
</pre>

<p>
  And then start playing (and reading if necessary) until you feel you
  understand the basic dynamics of the game.
</p>

<h2>Maps</h2>

<p>When installing XPilots-AI some standard maps are installed. When
starting the XPilot server with a specific map the full path to the
map has to be given. On the Sun systems the path to the standard maps
is:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">      /home/TDDD63/projects/xpilot-ai/maps/
</pre> 
<p>For example, to start the XPilot server with the standard map cross.xp (assuming group 1):</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">    xpilots -map /home/TDDD63/xpilot-ai/maps/cross.xp -noQuit \
    +reportToMetaServer -port 15346
</pre>


<p>There are some TDDD63 project specific <a href="http://heyer.ida.liu.se/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/">maps</a> available:</p>
<ul>  
<!--
  <li><a
  href="http://heyer.ida.liu.se/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/empty.xp">empty.xp</a>:
  Empty map with wrap around. The friction for this map is set to
  0.05.</li>

  <li><a
   href="http://heyer.ida.liu.se/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/emptynofriction.xp">emptynofriction.xp</a>:
   Empty map with wrap around. The friction for this map is set to
   0.0. The shot mass is set to 0 which lead to no movement of ship
   when firing a shot.</li>
-->

  <li><a
       href="http://heyer.ida.liu.se/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/emptyborder.xp">emptyborder.xp</a>:
       Empty map with a border which spaceships bounce in. The
       friction for this map is set to 0.05 and the shotspeed to 10.</li>

  <li><a
       href="http://heyer.ida.liu.se/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/emptybordernofriction.xp">emptybordernofriction.xp</a>:
       Empty map with a border which spaceships bounce in.  The shotspeed for this map is set to 10.</li>

  <li><a
       href="http://heyer.ida.liu.se/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/emptyborderlarge.xp">emptyborderlarge.xp</a>:
       Empty large map with a border which spaceships bounce in. The
       friction for this map is set to 0.05 and the shotspeed to 10. To be used if a larger
       area is needed to fly in.</li>


  <li><a
       href="http://heyer.ida.liu.se/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/simple.xp">simple.xp</a>:
       A simple map with boundary which spaceships can crash into and
       die. The shotspeed for this map is set to 21.</li>

  <li><a
       href="http://heyer.ida.liu.se/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/obstacle.xp">obstacle.xp</a>:
       A simple map with boundary which spaceships can crash into and
       die and obstacles that have to be avoided. The friction for
       this map is set to 0.1.</li>

</ul>
<p>On the Unix system these maps can be found in the directory:
<pre class="sh_sh">      /home/TDDD63/projects/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/
</pre> 

<p>To start the XPilot server with a map called simple.xp (assuming group 1).</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">
    xpilots -map /home/TDDD63/projects/xpilot-ai/tddd63maps/simple.xp -noQuit \
    +reportToMetaServer -port 15346
</pre>



<p>There is also a mapeditor <code>xp-mapedit</code> that can be used
to edit existing maps or creating new maps. If some parameters have bad values for the
task feel free to change some of the values and if new values work better please
check with the assistant that it is OK and so the new better values can be given to
the other groups also. It is also possible to edit the map files in a text editor.</p>

<p>The consequence of having a non-zero friction value is that the spaceship will stop after a while
if no thrust is applied. This makes it much easier to control the spaceship.</p>

<h2>Python API for XPilot-AI</h2>

<p>The Python API
  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Application
  Programming Interface</a>) for XPilot-AI
  is <a href="library.html">briefly
  documented</a>.</p>

<p>Note that if the documentation for example says:</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">   int asteroidX(int i) - Returns the specified enemy's X coordinate. 
</pre>
<p>Then the argument to <code>asteroidX</code> must be
an <code>int</code>. If it is not an <code>int</code> the call will
throw an exception (signal an error).</p>
<p>
  The <code>int</code> before the function name specifies the type of the value that the
  function returns.
</p>

<p>
  Notice also that i stands for index. The respective count function, in this case 
</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">   int asteroidCountScreen() - Returns the number of asteroids on the screen.
</pre>
<p>
  will give the number of valid items you can access with the index. Note that since
  the numbering starts at 0 the maximum index is one less than the number returned
  by the count functions. The API will return an error if you try to access an index
  that's out of the valid range.
</p>





<h2>Example Bot Code</h2>

<p>The Python interface works in the way that it gets regular
callbacks to a specific function that can do useful things. These kind
of callbacks are sometimes called "ticks". The system ticks your
program one step which usually corresponds to a specific time
step.</p>

<p>So the bot code will get a call for each "tick" and you can then
decide what to do. Exactly what should be done most probably depends
on what has happened before, therefore that information must be stored.
One way to do that is to implement the bot code as
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state
machine</a> where the state in a sense encodes this history
information.</p>

<p>
  Here is code for a minimal example, where the AI simply shoots every tick
</p>
<pre class="sh_python">
import libpyAI as ai

def AI_loop():
    ai.fireShot()

ai.start(AI_loop,["-name","Shooter"])
</pre>

<p>Here is the code for a <a href="stub.py">stub program</a> that can be used as a starting
point for the bots that are going to be written in this project.
  In the current code the AI doesn't actually do anything, this is just a minimal example.
</p>



<h3>Running a Bot</h3>

<p>If you have used the Python stub given above the bot program is started by
using the group flag in the following way (assuming your program is called stub.py):</p>
<pre class="sh_sh">  python3 stub.py -port 15346
</pre>

<p>Notice that is is possible to use the keyboard to control the spaceship when
running the Python bot program.</p>

<h2>Project: Introductory Phase</h2>

<p>The project tasks for the introductory phase are to write one or
more bot programs that do the tasks below. The tasks should be
implemented in order.</p>

<ol>

    <li>
    <h4>Shoot stationary targets</h4>
    <p>
    <b>Goal:</b> Destroy all targets before they reappear.<br>
    <b>Map:</b> <a href="maps/exc1_map_targets.xp">exc1_map_targets.xp</a><br>
    <b>Provided code:</b> <a href="exc1_code_skeleton.py">exc1_code_skeleton.py</a><br>
    <b>Description:</b> In this exercise you will be guided by the skeleton code provided and you should follow
    the inscructions in it. You should only have to enter code where it is said. The skeleton code also provides you with
    useful functions, if you need to look up how they work you can find links to them in the recommended functions.<br>
    <b>Recommended functions:</b>
    <a href="library.html#control">API control</a>,
    <a href="library.html#self">Ship properties</a>,
    <a href="library.html#target">Target</a>,
    <a href="library.html#turn">Turn</a>,
    <a href="library.html#angle_handling">Angle handling</a>,
    <a href="library.html#shoot">Shoot</a> and 
    Python's built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html#angular-conversion">angular conversion</a> and
    <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html#trigonometric-functions">trigonometric functions</a>,
    especially
    <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html#math.atan2">math.atan2</a>.
    
    </p>
    </li>

    <a name="race"></a>
    <li>
    <h4>Race</h4>
    <p>
    <b>Goal:</b> Complete all three laps.<br>
    <b>Map:</b> <a href="maps/exc2_map_race.xp">exc2_map_race.xp</a><br>
    <b>Provided code:</b> <a href="stub.py">stub.py</a><br>
    <b>Description:</b> This exercise introduces a new game mode, race (or timing, as it's also called). Racing
    consist of flying by several checkpoints, predefined in the map file, completing a set amount of laps. The game
    restarts when the first person have completed all laps. Different maps have different settings on how close
    to a checkpoint you have to be to "get" it.<br>
    <br>
    The easiest way to solve this exercise is to:<br>
    1. Save the or coordinates of the next checkpoint using nextCheckPoint, checkPointX and checkPointY.<br>
    2. Fly towards the checkpoint.<br>
    3. When close enough, brake the ship (turn around and thrust).<br>
    4. Goto 1<br>
    <br>
    For this you need a minimum of two states, "travel" and "stop", but it can be useful to have more.<br>
    
    <b>Recommended functions:</b>
    <a href="library.html#race">Checkpoint</a>,
    <a href="library.html#movement">Movement</a> and those introduced in exercise 1.
    </p></li>

    <li>
    <h4>Distant targets</h4>
    <p>
    <b>Goal:</b> Shoot down all four targets before they respawn.<br>
    <b>Map:</b> <a href="maps/exc3_map_distantTargets.xp">exc3_map_distantTargets.xp</a><br>
    <b>Description:</b>This exercise is very similar to the first one, except for the map being bigger and the ship being able to move.
    Shots fired retains the velocity of your ship, so it is much easier to hit the targets
    if you slow down the ship. With no friction it is almost impossible to stop the ship completely, so your solution
    should not rely on that.<br>
    <b>Recommended functions:</b>
    All recommended functions have been introduced in earlier exercises.
    </p>
    </li>

    <a name="asteroids"></a>
    <li>
    <h4>Asteroids</h4>
    <p>
    <b>Goal:</b> Reach 100 points before running out of fuel.<br> <!--TODO: how much?-->
    <b>Map:</b> <a href="maps/exc4_map_asteroids.xp">exc4_map_asteroids.xp</a><br>
    <b>Provided code:</b> <a href="stub.py">stub.py</a><br>
    <b>Description:</b> This exercise introduses asteroids, which are normally implemented as additional hazards on maps,
    but in this exercise there will only be asteroids, much like the classical game
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)">Asteroids</a>.<br>
    Fuel is also introduced in this map. You lose fuel when thrusting, shooting and colliding
    with objects. If you collide with an asteroid with low fuel you will die. Avoiding asteroids
    is not a part of this exercise, so shoot them before they can reach you.<br>

    <!--<p>I have removed this exercise for several reasons.
    1. shotAlert is inconsistent and needs to be looked upon.
    2. I recently changed it not to have walls, and it needs further testing to figure
        out good numbers, goal and other tweaks.
        2a. Reason I changed it was because it was super hard to avoid shots, walls, and getting close to the cannon.
    3. Lack of time.

Fly to a specific position while avoiding obstacles and walls and stop

<h2>Project Main Phase</h2>

<p>
    You should now have good insight into what is possible to do with xpilot
    and have been introduced to most of the functionality of it. Now you may choose
    between one of the three projects described below, or specify your own. If you
    specify your own main phase it must be approved by the assistant.
</p>

<p>
  As in all TDDD63 projects it is difficult to predict exactly how
  many tasks you will be able to complete.  You might implement
  all of them and continue with additional extensions, or you may not
  be able to complete the entire list.  To make sure you are
  progressing at a sufficient pace, keep your assistant up to date on
  your progress during the progress report sessions!
</p>

<p>
    The tasks are very loosely defined and sometimes doesn't even supply
    a map. You are then expected to supply this on your own and decide when you're
    finished with it. The assistant will therefore not grade you based on the number
    of tasks you have accomplished, but rather on how much time and work your group have
    laid down. The easiest way to create maps is to copy the ones supplied and
    modify them, either with a text editor or with <code>xp-mapedit</code>.
</p>

<p>
    You do <b>not</b> need to implement the tasks in order, and you're encouraged to
    pick and choose the ones you want to do.
</p>

<h4>Available projects</h4>
<dl>
    <dt><b><a href="#fighter">Fighter bot</a></b></dt>
    <dd>Improve on the bot you wrote in exc. 3, but this time it should fight
    against enemy ships. In later tasks you add support for walls, dodging enemy bullets,
    multiple enemies, items, navigation, gravity, fuelstations and many other server options and
    map features.
    <dt><b><a href="#racing">Racing</a></b></dt>
    <dd>Improve on the bot you wrote in exc. 2 and add support for different maps.

<h3>Project: Fighter bot</h3>

<p>
    By choosing this project you've decided to write the ultimate killer robot. It is not very
    hard to write a bot capable of beating a human with some specific map options, but a human
    is much more adaptable and can
    adjust and learn to play with almost every possible combination of settings and maps. It is
    also very good to maintain contact with other groups that chooses to write a fighter bot and
    compete with them.
</p>

<p>
    Try to preserve the support for previous maps when moving onto later. This is best done by
    using <a href="library#getOption">getOption</a> to support as many changing map options as
    possible. This is entirely optional, and if you find it too hard you can make a separate program
    for each task. You can also adjust the difficulty by changing options in the maps, making
    it easier or harder depending on how you're faring.
</p>

<p>
    If you've fallen in love with fighting asteroids you can change almost all of the exercises
    to include asteroids instead of enemies. To make it harder you can either have very high
    asteroid density, forcing you to fight for your life, or have very low, forcing you to track
    them down via the radar.

    <a href="library#enemy">enemy functions</a>. Try it out vs human players, started with the xpilot
    client, and/or vs other bots. You can either launch several copies of your own bot, invite another group
    to join your server or launch the server without the <a href="#reportMeta">reportToMetaServer</a> flag, letting bots
    and players roaming the internet join. There are always bots on the internet that will join your server, but
    it is rare to find other humans. You can restrict the number of internet bots by changing
    <a href="http://www.j-a-r-n-o.nl/xpilotserver.html#maxrobots">maxRobots</a> in the mapfile.

    often certain items spawn, or
    <a href="http://www.j-a-r-n-o.nl/xpilotserver.html#initialfuel">initial*</a> to determine how many you start with.
    Many other options change the the behaviour of items and modifiers.<br>
    It's suggested you start with only mines and/or missiles, and then move on to add more.<br>

<h3>Project: Bots Cooperating in Teams</h3>

<p>If you choose this project, you will implement a bot that works in
a team with other instances of the same bot. This project includes
inventing your own very simple communication language and implementing
the parsing of it.</p>

<p>To help with the communication code a help class <a
href="botcom.py">BotCom</a> have been written and documentaion can be
found <a href="botcom.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Here is the code for a <a href="teamstub.py">stub program</a> that can be used as a starting
point for the cooperating bots that are going to be written in this project. This file also shows
how to use BotCom.</p>

<p>The tasks should during development at least be tested with a
  team size of 3 but the program should work for bigger team sizes so
  it is good to test with for example team sizes 5 and 7
  sometimes. Remember to start the server with the flag <code>-maxClientsPerIP</code> specifying
  for example 10 as the maximum.
</p>


<ol>

<li><p>Fly in formation. Communicate among the leader and members of the team
to decide which position a spaceship should
assume and so on. Implement different formations and
change between them while flying around. Use for example
<a href="maps/empyborderlarge.xp">emptyborderlarge.xp</a> map to test with.  Note that the  way
to get the position of the other ships in the team fast enough is to use the
BotCom based communication.
</p></li>

<li><p>Team that shoots down enemies. Design scenarios were
cooperation is used. One example of that is to suppose that only one
spaceship have a radar to find the enemies and only the other
spaceships can fire and destroy the enemy. In this task the enemies can be single
ships that do not cooperate and do not fire back.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="maps/obstacle.xp">obstacle.xp</a> is 32x32 in size. Each wall element
corresponds to one square. Read in the map file and build up a data
structure representing the world with the walls. Use that map to fly the spaceship
to specific positions in the world.
</p></li>

<li><p>Given that all bots in the team have read in the map <a href="maps/obstacle.xp">obstacle.xp</a>.
The task here is to have moving and non-moving enemies in the <a href="maps/obstacle.xp">obstacle.xp</a> world
and cooperate as a team to decide who will kill who and then kill all the enemies.
</p></li>

<!--
<li><p>Team that shoots down asteroids. Have the team cooperate in
some way to avoid killing your own team members. THIS MUST BE TESTED
TO SEE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DETECT ASTEROIDS.</p></li>
-->

<li><p>Implement the functionallity for team death matchs. Demonstrate
by competing with yourself or with other groups bot programs.
Implement different strategies that a team can have (for example
defensive, aggressive, ...). The bots for one team should not read the
other teams talk messages so the messages has to be marked with a team
identifier. Feel free to construct your own maps here that suits the
functionality that has been implemented.</p></li>

<li><p>Build a map of the environment by letting different members of
the team explore different parts of the world and communicate the
result between the team members continuously. The code should work for
the <a href="maps/obstacle.xp">obstacle.xp</a> map but feel free to test it with other maps
also. Use the <code>wallFeeler()</code> function to create the map
the environment.</p></li>

<li><p>Team death matchs while simultaneously building and using the
partial map of the environment.</p></li>

<!--
<li><p>Have a tournament between teams.</p></li>

<h3>FSM in Python</h3>

<p>Maybe describe an FSM module here. Or maybe it is better to just write the programs
without support for FSM?</p>
-->

<h3>Python Style Guide: PEP 8</h3>

<p>When programming it is good to follow some style guide. On popular
guide for Python programs are <a
href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a>. The example
programs in this document does not follow this guide exactly but that
is no reason not to read the style guide and follow it.</p>

<p>Here are the most important points of PEP 8 (taken from the Python 3.3 tutorial):</p>
<ul>

<li>Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.

4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows
greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs
introduce confusion, and are best left out.
</li>

<li>Wrap lines so that they don't exceed 79 characters.

This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have
several code files side-by-side on larger displays.  </li>

<li>Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.</li>

<li>When possible, put comments on a line of their own.</li>

<li>Use docstrings.</li>

<li>Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside
bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).</li>

<li>Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use
CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions
and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument
(see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).</li>

<li>Don't use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python's default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.</li>

<li>Likewise, don't use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.</li>

</ul>
